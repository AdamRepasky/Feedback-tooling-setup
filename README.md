# Feedback-tooling-setup

This serves as brief manual how to setup the evironment used to develop and test the "feedback tools" for BBMRI. 

I have used [VM ware workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) to tun virtual instance of [ubuntu-22.04.2-desktop-amd64](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) on my host machine with Windows 10.

Setup:

1. On the ubuntu VM download [beam](https://github.com/samply/beam#development-environment) and start the default development environment by running `./dev/beamdev start`
